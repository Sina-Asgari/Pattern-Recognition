# Pattern-Recognition

In this repo I put 3 projects that we do in our pattern regocnition class in IUST teached by DR.Morteza Analoui

## Project 1
In this project, we classify comments in IMDB dataset (Sentiment analysis) in two positive and negative groups
- first we preprocess the comments, like removing HTML tags, Punctuations, Stop Words and Lemmatization Words
- then classify them using Bag of Words (BoW), BERT Embedding, TF-IDF and Word2Vec

## Project 2
In this project, we worked with imbalanced datasets and worked with RB-Boost, SMOTE-Boost, RUS-BOOST and Ada-Boost-M2 machines.

## Project 3
In this project, we try to do Signature Verification using deep learning models like Xception, ResNet50 and SVM model
- first we use Xception and ResNet50 that was trained on ImageNet and add new head on top of them for classifying Signatures and then fine tuned them.
- in another step, I build a new model and train it from scratch 
- in third step I use Xception as a feature extactor and do classification using Support Vector Machine
